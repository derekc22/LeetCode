        Uses a recursive approach

        Time Complexity: O(n)
        We iterate through all n nodes

        Space Complexity: O(h)
        Where h is the tree height
        This space usage comes from the call stack in the recursion
        The deeper the, the more recursive calls need to be made
        In the worst case, all n nodes are in a single line, h = n
        In the best case, all n nodes are arranged in a balanced fashion, h = log(n)

        In the worst case (skewed tree), h = n, so space complexity is O(n)
        In the best/average case (balanced tree), h = log n, so space complexity is O(log n)

        Quick derivation:
        Draw out a balanced binary tree. Notice that at each level, the number of nodes at that level is double the number of nodes at the prior level
        We can say that ni = 2^hi
        That is, the number of nodes at height=i is follows a base 2 power function
        The total number of nodes is therefore, n = âˆ‘ 2^hi, i=0 to h
        This is a geometric series that simplifies to, n = 2^(h+1) - 1
        Solving for h yields, h = log(n+1) - 1
        Asymptotically this yields, h = log n
